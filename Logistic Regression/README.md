Objective: Build a model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default (binary classification).

This project uses the German Credit Data available on UCI ML repositiry and performs Logistic Regression on the dataset to classify customers based on credit risk. 
Good Credit (Class 1) and Bad Credit (0).

The project is divided into multiple steps:
step-1 : Dataset selection (German Credit Data available on Kaggle and UCI ML repository)
step-2 : Set up Environment
step-3 : Data Loading and Exploration
step-4 : Data Preprocessing
step-5 : Model Building
step-6 : Model evaluation
step-7 : Interpreting Feature Importance
